# Ask Me Anything

This is a lightweight ask-me-anything experiment.

Anything is fair game. Ask away!

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/raganwald/AMA/issues/new) on this
repo.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can. Once I answer I'll close the issue so I
know what I've covered, but don't worry&mdash;if you have any further questions
just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a
question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/raganwald/AMA/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@raganwald](https://twitter.com/raganwald) on
Twitter.
